			<h1>Why Is Scotland an Awesome Place to Get Married?</h1>

			<i>So many locations, such a special occasion - it can be tough to find the perfect place for your big day. Scotland is often chosen by betrothed couples to hold their ceremony (and honeymoon). But why?</i>

			<p class="bd-p1">There's just something about Scotland and weddings.</p>

			<p>For centuries, Gretna Green has been an alluring spot for marriage. Straddled against the Scottish border, differing marriage laws in England and Scotland meant it stood as a place where English couples could elope in a fit of youthful ardour.</p> 

			<p>Today, those laws long-since equalised, it still holds its great romantic power. Gretna and Scotland are synonymous with marriage.</p> 

			<p>So, why is it still so appealing today?</p>

			<p>Scotland is, simply, a national manifestation of authenticity, from its jaw-dropping glens and lochs, built over centuries of deep time, to the personalities found in its population, who are known internationally for honesty, humour, pragmatism and warmth.</p> 

			<p>Everything about Scotland is rooted in the real. Today, such a place is truly nourishing.</p> 

			<p>Perhaps there's something in its water, the freshness and clarity of which is commonly championed by visiting drinkers.</p>

			<p>But perhaps it's not just water they're drinking.</p>

			<p>Distilleries all over the country produce some of the finest whiskey (with an 'e') in the world; Johnnie Walker, The Macallan, Glenfiddich - and so many more, keeping bodies warm during the cold winter nights (and spring nights, and summer nights...). Scots brace against the elements and trod them down with warmth.</p>

			<p>No wonder, then, that so many from near and far afield find this Scotland an ideal environment for them to express - with a bit of Scotch courage - their deepest vulnerabilities in front of those closest and accept another into their life.</p>  

			<p>Really - where better to have a wedding? The contrast between the funny, musical culture of Scotland and its strange, moody landscapes - Skye, Lewis, Edinburgh, Loch Ness, Ullapool, to name a tiny few - imbues the country with dramatic intensity, irresistible to those newlyweds seeking a distinctive set of memories. It is an environment supercharged with emotion.</p>

			<p>From wave farms to wildlife protection, Scotland is singular in sustaining and renewing. Strong marriages are hardwired in. It looks backwards and forwards simultaneously, matching its bounty of traditions with an openness to new ways. Visitors always run into contrast and surprise, as well as the humour, empathy and self-awareness that make Scottish weddings so relaxed and enjoyable.</p>

			<p>Why is Scotland an awesome place to get married? Well, there's a short answer for you: it inspires awe.</p> 

			<p>But there's more, too. Formal, informal, new and old sit happily together at the Scottish table, revelling in music, world-class food and drink, and, most importantly, patter.</p>
