			<p>GLASGOW, SCOTLAND &#8212; Teenage Fanclub are chuffed to announce the release of their next album, <i>Endless Arcade</i>, following 2016's <i>Here</i>.</p>

			<p>This is the Fannies' first album with new member Euros Childs (of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci) after he joined the band in January 2019. The full lineup comprises of: Norman Blake (rhythm guitar, vocals), Raymond McGinley (lead guitar, vocals), Euros Childs (keyboards, vocals), Dave McGowan (bass) and Francis MacDonald (drums).</p>

			<p>Building on sounds featured in the lead singles 'Everything is Falling Apart', 'Home' and 'I'm More Inclined', <i>Endless Arcade</i> holds honeyed melodies, jangling guitars and meditative words. For troubled times, it's a small, sunny antidote.</p> 

			<p>Of the title, Raymond says: "I think of an endless arcade as a city that you can wander through, with a sense of mystery - an imaginary one that goes on forever." All songs on the album were written by Norman and Raymond, with contributions from the band. The album was self-produced by Teenage Fanclub.</p>

			<p class="bold">This is the full tracklist:</p>

			<ol class="tracklist-ol">

			</ol>

			<p><i>Endless Arcade</i> will be released to the public on the 30th of April 2021, via PeMa and Merge. In support of the album, the band will be touring with some UK dates in September 2021, followed by a full European and American tour in April and May 2022.</p>
