		<h1>#CancelCovid</h1>
		<h2>We can wipe out coronavirus if we work together.</h2>
		<p>We have two potent tools to combat COVID-19: information and vaccination.</p> 
		<p><b>#CancelCovid</b> is a nonprofit initiative meant to sharpen the power of data while we wait for vaccines to roll out. We produce <b>infographics</b>, <b>web resources</b> and other <b>easily-digestible materials</b> about COVID-19, to be freely shared online.</p>

		<p>The resources are made by experienced creative professionals. This lends the facts more legitimacy, to sway the unsure or unconvinced. The idea is to create a stream of <b>simple, practical knowledge</b> and help science-backed advice reach as many as possible.</p>

		<p>Simple doesn't mean simplistic. The novel coronavirus is an incredibly complex problem, biologically, politically and personally. Part of our job is to refigure stats from across the world and make them accessible to the public.</p>

		<p><b>So let's start with the basics:</b></p> 
		<div class="cancel-body flex">
			<div class="cancel-tiles flex tile-row">
				<div class="wash tile">
					<img src="images/wash-hands.png" />
					<h3>Wash your hands</h3>
					<p>We touch our own faces about 23 times an hour&sup1. That's 23 chances for coronavirus particles to enter your body, via your mouth, nose or eyes. Soap kills the virus.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="wear tile">
					<img src="images/wear-mask.png" />
					<h3>Wear a mask</h3>
					<p>Coronavirus is transmitted through fine droplets in the air, from coughs, sneezes and even breathing. A multi-layer cloth mask blocks 50 to 70% of droplets&sup2.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="work tile">
					<img src="images/work-home.png">
					<h3>Work from home</h3>
					<p>We know that coronavirus can only spread when two people come into contact. Employers must ensure this happens as little as possible.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="cancel-undertiles flex tile-row">
				<div class="distance-pic tile">
					<img src="images/social-distance.png">
				</div>
				<div class="distance-text flex tile">
					<h3>And always keep a safe distance.</h3>
					<p>It has been proven that the virus doesn't tend to linger on surfaces&sup3. So if you must go out, your best course is to stay at least two metres apart from others.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="cancel-bottom flex">
			<h3>What next?</h3>
			<p class="cancel-mission follow-up">These are facts we have all heard countless times. But the more we see an idea, the more it sinks in, becoming second nature. What if we could internalise even more aspects of the pandemic? What do you - or those around you - know about vaccine efficacy, incubation periods, or Vitamin D? Provisional information is out there, but it often gets lots in the shuffle.</p> 

			<p>Less confusion means a more focused drive against the virus.</p>
			
			<p>To help with this drive yourself, have a look through our resources and share anything you like. Remember to use the hashtag <b>#CancelCovid</b> to help this initiative build momentum and make a real difference.</p>
